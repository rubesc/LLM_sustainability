# Sustainable Initiatives LLM Generator


This tool, powered by OpenAI's language model (LLM), aims to provide personalized suggestions for sustainable initiatives based on user inputs. The user provides their location (in any format such as zip code, city name, neighborhood, country, etc.), and the tool generates a prompt suggesting actionable sustainable initiatives.
